Calculators for behaviors of Precast Concrete Columns (PCC)

The CalculatorES is for calculating effective stiffness of precast concrete columns, which includes 21 input parameters. It needs to be downloaded alone and runs with the Angle.pkl and Angle_scaler.pkl at the same folder. The CalculatorDC is for calculating drift capacity of precast concrete columns, which includes 11 input parameters. It needs to be downloaded alone and runs with the VEL.pkl and VEL_scaler.pkl at the same folder.

These calculators were all developed by Dr. Liu Tongxu from University of Montreal and Dr. Wang zhen from University of Hongkong. If you have any question using it, please consult the paper named in Engineering Structures or Contact email: tongxu.liu@polymtl.ca.

Thanks for your usage.
