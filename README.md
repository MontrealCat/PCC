Calculators for behaviors of Precast Concrete Columns (PCC)

The CalculatorDC is for calculating drift capacity of precast concrete columns, which was developed by Dr. Liu Tongxu from University of Montreal and Dr. Wang zhen from University of Hongkong.

The executable file needs to be run with the Angle.pkl and Angle scaler.pkl at the same folder.

If you have any question using it, please consult the paper named in Engineering Structures or Contact email: tongxu.liu@polymtl.ca.

Thanks for your usage.
